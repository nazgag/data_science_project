# Population Trends in Saudi Arabia

## Overview
This project explores population trends in different regions of Saudi Arabia using data science techniques. The goal is to analyze a dataset containing demographic information over several years to uncover insights that can help us understand population dynamics and trends in the country.

## Data
The dataset used contains demographic information, including gender, nationality, region, year, and population count for each region in Saudi Arabia. It spans multiple years, allowing analysis of population trends over time.

## CRISP-DM Process
The project follows the CRISP-DM process, including stages such as Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment.

## Questions Explored
The analysis aims to answer questions related to population trends in Saudi Arabia, including changes over the years in different regions, gender distribution trends, differences in population growth rates between regions, and urban-rural population dynamics.

## Analysis and Visualization
The analysis involves exploring, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis, followed by visualizing the findings using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Descriptive statistics, charts, and graphs are used to communicate insights from the data.

## Repository Structure
- `Project1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `data`: Folder containing the dataset used for analysis.

## Results
The analysis reveals insights into population trends in Saudi Arabia, including variations in population growth rates across regions, gender distribution patterns, and urban-rural population dynamics.
